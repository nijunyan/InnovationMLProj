    "PrjName": "Perttu, co-founder of Radbahn , has presented the concept for the cycle path below the U1 in Berlin. The special feature of this line: over several kilometers, it does not run underground, but runs on a route made of steel. The space underneath is largely unused - ideal for creating a covered bicycle path that leads from the southeast of the city to the west . Cycle track is more than a bike path At selected locations, electricity is to be generated by means of photovoltaic elements or the kinetic energy of cars crossing the route. This is then available at charging stations for electric cars or bicycles. In addition, the median strip is to become an urban meeting place. VibRad has just won the \"Radbahn + Innovators\" competition. In their concept, tubes are suspended from the route on a partial section. By subway wagons and passing cars resulting vibration is thus converted into energy. This is fed into the circuit and also produces light at the ends of the tubes. Radbahn has already won prestigious awards, aroused great interest among German and international media and completed a successful crowdfunding campaign",
