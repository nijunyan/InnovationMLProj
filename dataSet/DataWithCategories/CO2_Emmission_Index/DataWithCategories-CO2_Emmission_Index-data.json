The management of T\u00c3\u0153V Rheinland Immobiliengesellschaft mbH & Co. KG has developed an innovative concept with the engineering experts from Drees & Sommer as energy designer, building physicist and TGA planner: In future, there should only be one energy center. All buildings in the property are supplied with heat and cooling via the power grid of the new energy center. For heat supply, hybrid energy sources are used. These consist of the renewable raw material wood, a wood pellet boiler plant, as well as the fossil energy natural gas, gas condensing boilers and an integrated combined heat and power plant. The cold is generated by free-cooling, high-efficiency compression machines and absorption chillers. This can save 30 percent of primary energy compared to today. In addition, CO2 emissions will be reduced by more than 30 percent. The overall concept is modular in design and adaptable for the future.",

The need for heating is already low due to the good insulation of the evohaus architecture anyway. Remaining heat demand is covered by solar power. The solar power drives heat pumps that produce about three kilowatt hours of heat energy for heating or hot water with one kilowatt hour of electrical energy. The settlement gets its heat independent of gas, coal or other fossil fuels. The heat pumps are preferably switched on when enough solar power is generated. Water tanks store excess heat and provide the settlement with sunless times. An energy management system monitors and controls storage tanks and heat pumps. The evohaus irq concept is taking the step from a passive house to an active house: it not only saves energy but also generates electricity itself and uses it with intelligence.",

    "PrjName": "\"Green tires\" reduce the fuel consumption of vehicles in urban traffic by up to seven percent (on average by 4.1 percent) and can save fleet operators thousands of euros in costs each year. In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time.

The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time.

The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

Our first priority is to cut in half the total energy demand of the city until 2050 and then cover the rest with renewable energy and/or waste heat. To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally. This is why we want to increase the share of district heating in the city.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers.

With smart homes and smart meters in the network, homeowners and store owners can reduce their electricity and heating costs by an average of 7%! Add to that the great comfort of making the apartment burglar-proof and controlling almost every aspect of heating, electricity or security in the building. So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such. B. that the fire department is called. In order to test some scenarios and saving opportunities in everyday life and to make known the possibilities offered by these modern technologies, Smart Home applications were installed on the Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e in nine private apartments of the Nippes Tower and in the bookstore Neusser Stra\u00c3\u0178e. This was financed by the project Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e or the company RocketHome . In addition, it is planned to equip the entire climate road with smart meters from RheinEnergie.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

The management of T\u00c3\u0153V Rheinland Immobiliengesellschaft mbH & Co. KG has developed an innovative concept with the engineering experts from Drees & Sommer as energy designer, building physicist and TGA planner: In future, there should only be one energy center. All buildings in the property are supplied with heat and cooling via the power grid of the new energy center. For heat supply, hybrid energy sources are used. These consist of the renewable raw material wood, a wood pellet boiler plant, as well as the fossil energy natural gas, gas condensing boilers and an integrated combined heat and power plant. The cold is generated by free-cooling, high-efficiency compression machines and absorption chillers. This can save 30 percent of primary energy compared to today. In addition, CO2 emissions will be reduced by more than 30 percent. The overall concept is modular in design and adaptable for the future.",

The solar power drives heat pumps that produce about three kilowatt hours of heat energy for heating or hot water with one kilowatt hour of electrical energy. The settlement gets its heat independent of gas, coal or other fossil fuels. The heat pumps are preferably switched on when enough solar power is generated. Water tanks store excess heat and provide the settlement with sunless times. An energy management system monitors and controls storage tanks and heat pumps.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

Our first priority is to cut in half the total energy demand of the city until 2050 and then cover the rest with renewable energy and/or waste heat. To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally. This is why we want to increase the share of district heating in the city.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

With smart homes and smart meters in the network, homeowners and store owners can reduce their electricity and heating costs by an average of 7%! Add to that the great comfort of making the apartment burglar-proof and controlling almost every aspect of heating, electricity or security in the building. So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such. B. that the fire department is called. In order to test some scenarios and saving opportunities in everyday life and to make known the possibilities offered by these modern technologies, Smart Home applications were installed on the Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e in nine private apartments of the Nippes Tower and in the bookstore Neusser Stra\u00c3\u0178e. This was financed by the project Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e or the company RocketHome . In addition, it is planned to equip the entire climate road with smart meters from RheinEnergie.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such.

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

The management of T\u00c3\u0153V Rheinland Immobiliengesellschaft mbH & Co. KG has developed an innovative concept with the engineering experts from Drees & Sommer as energy designer, building physicist and TGA planner: In future, there should only be one energy center. All buildings in the property are supplied with heat and cooling via the power grid of the new energy center. For heat supply, hybrid energy sources are used. These consist of the renewable raw material wood, a wood pellet boiler plant, as well as the fossil energy natural gas, gas condensing boilers and an integrated combined heat and power plant. The cold is generated by free-cooling, high-efficiency compression machines and absorption chillers. This can save 30 percent of primary energy compared to today. In addition, CO2 emissions will be reduced by more than 30 percent. The overall concept is modular in design and adaptable for the future.",

The need for heating is already low due to the good insulation of the evohaus architecture anyway. Remaining heat demand is covered by solar power. The solar power drives heat pumps that produce about three kilowatt hours of heat energy for heating or hot water with one kilowatt hour of electrical energy. The settlement gets its heat independent of gas, coal or other fossil fuels. The heat pumps are preferably switched on when enough solar power is generated. Water tanks store excess heat and provide the settlement with sunless times. An energy management system monitors and controls storage tanks and heat pumps.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

The start-up has developed its own smart meter gateway, which not only measures and displays the power consumption live, but can even recognize some of the appliances used in the household based on specific consumption data. With the help of real-time data, more transparency is created and users can precisely optimize their power consumption.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

Our first priority is to cut in half the total energy demand of the city until 2050 and then cover the rest with renewable energy and/or waste heat. To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally. This is why we want to increase the share of district heating in the city.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

With smart homes and smart meters in the network, homeowners and store owners can reduce their electricity and heating costs by an average of 7%! Add to that the great comfort of making the apartment burglar-proof and controlling almost every aspect of heating, electricity or security in the building. So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such. B. that the fire department is called. In order to test some scenarios and saving opportunities in everyday life and to make known the possibilities offered by these modern technologies, Smart Home applications were installed on the Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e in nine private apartments of the Nippes Tower and in the bookstore Neusser Stra\u00c3\u0178e.

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such. B. that the fire department is called. In order to test some scenarios and saving opportunities in everyday life and to make known the possibilities offered by these modern technologies, Smart Home applications were installed on the Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e in nine private apartments of the Nippes Tower and in the bookstore Neusser Stra\u00c3\u0178e. This was financed by the project Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e or the company RocketHome . In addition, it is planned to equip the entire climate road with smart meters from RheinEnergie.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such.

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

The management of T\u00c3\u0153V Rheinland Immobiliengesellschaft mbH & Co. KG has developed an innovative concept with the engineering experts from Drees & Sommer as energy designer, building physicist and TGA planner: In future, there should only be one energy center. All buildings in the property are supplied with heat and cooling via the power grid of the new energy center. For heat supply, hybrid energy sources are used. These consist of the renewable raw material wood, a wood pellet boiler plant, as well as the fossil energy natural gas, gas condensing boilers and an integrated combined heat and power plant. The cold is generated by free-cooling, high-efficiency compression machines and absorption chillers. This can save 30 percent of primary energy compared to today. In addition, CO2 emissions will be reduced by more than 30 percent. The overall concept is modular in design and adaptable for the future.",

The need for heating is already low due to the good insulation of the evohaus architecture anyway. Remaining heat demand is covered by solar power. The solar power drives heat pumps that produce about three kilowatt hours of heat energy for heating or hot water with one kilowatt hour of electrical energy. The settlement gets its heat independent of gas, coal or other fossil fuels. The heat pumps are preferably switched on when enough solar power is generated. Water tanks store excess heat and provide the settlement with sunless times. An energy management system monitors and controls storage tanks and heat pumps.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

Our first priority is to cut in half the total energy demand of the city until 2050 and then cover the rest with renewable energy and/or waste heat. To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally. This is why we want to increase the share of district heating in the city.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers.

With smart homes and smart meters in the network, homeowners and store owners can reduce their electricity and heating costs by an average of 7%! Add to that the great comfort of making the apartment burglar-proof and controlling almost every aspect of heating, electricity or security in the building. So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such. B. that the fire department is called. In order to test some scenarios and saving opportunities in everyday life and to make known the possibilities offered by these modern technologies, Smart Home applications were installed on the Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e in nine private apartments of the Nippes Tower and in the bookstore Neusser Stra\u00c3\u0178e.

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

Our first priority is to cut in half the total energy demand of the city until 2050 and then cover the rest with renewable energy and/or waste heat. To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally. This is why we want to increase the share of district heating in the city.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such. B. that the fire department is called. In order to test some scenarios and saving opportunities in everyday life and to make known the possibilities offered by these modern technologies, Smart Home applications were installed on the Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e in nine private apartments of the Nippes Tower and in the bookstore Neusser Stra\u00c3\u0178e. This was financed by the project Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e or the company RocketHome . In addition, it is planned to equip the entire climate road with smart meters from RheinEnergie.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such.

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

KG has developed an innovative concept with the engineering experts from Drees & Sommer as energy designer, building physicist and TGA planner: In future, there should only be one energy center. All buildings in the property are supplied with heat and cooling via the power grid of the new energy center. For heat supply, hybrid energy sources are used. These consist of the renewable raw material wood, a wood pellet boiler plant, as well as the fossil energy natural gas, gas condensing boilers and an integrated combined heat and power plant. The cold is generated by free-cooling, high-efficiency compression machines and absorption chillers. This can save 30 percent of primary energy compared to today. In addition, CO2 emissions will be reduced by more than 30 percent. The overall concept is modular in design and adaptable for the future.",

The solar power drives heat pumps that produce about three kilowatt hours of heat energy for heating or hot water with one kilowatt hour of electrical energy. The settlement gets its heat independent of gas, coal or other fossil fuels. The heat pumps are preferably switched on when enough solar power is generated. Water tanks store excess heat and provide the settlement with sunless times. An energy management system monitors and controls storage tanks and heat pumps.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

For example, by replacing old appliances which - now recognizable - consume a lot of energy with new ones or choose a different time of day with more favorable electricity prices for the use of a washing machine or dishwasher. The Discovergy user interface works both in the browser and via an app on the smartphone or tablet.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

Our first priority is to cut in half the total energy demand of the city until 2050 and then cover the rest with renewable energy and/or waste heat. To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally. This is why we want to increase the share of district heating in the city.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such.

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

The management of T\u00c3\u0153V Rheinland Immobiliengesellschaft mbH & Co. KG has developed an innovative concept with the engineering experts from Drees & Sommer as energy designer, building physicist and TGA planner: In future, there should only be one energy center. All buildings in the property are supplied with heat and cooling via the power grid of the new energy center. For heat supply, hybrid energy sources are used. These consist of the renewable raw material wood, a wood pellet boiler plant, as well as the fossil energy natural gas, gas condensing boilers and an integrated combined heat and power plant. The cold is generated by free-cooling, high-efficiency compression machines and absorption chillers. This can save 30 percent of primary energy compared to today. In addition, CO2 emissions will be reduced by more than 30 percent. The overall concept is modular in design and adaptable for the future.",

The need for heating is already low due to the good insulation of the evohaus architecture anyway. Remaining heat demand is covered by solar power. The solar power drives heat pumps that produce about three kilowatt hours of heat energy for heating or hot water with one kilowatt hour of electrical energy. The settlement gets its heat independent of gas, coal or other fossil fuels. The heat pumps are preferably switched on when enough solar power is generated. Water tanks store excess heat and provide the settlement with sunless times. An energy management system monitors and controls storage tanks and heat pumps. The evohaus irq concept is taking the step from a passive house to an active house: it not only saves energy but also generates electricity itself and uses it with intelligence.",

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

With the help of real-time data, more transparency is created and users can precisely optimize their power consumption. For example, by replacing old appliances which - now recognizable - consume a lot of energy with new ones or choose a different time of day with more favorable electricity prices for the use of a washing machine or dishwasher. The Discovergy user interface works both in the browser and via an app on the smartphone or tablet. There is also the option to subscribe to evaluations or to receive notifications when exceptional consumption is perceived.",

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

Our first priority is to cut in half the total energy demand of the city until 2050 and then cover the rest with renewable energy and/or waste heat. To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally. This is why we want to increase the share of district heating in the city.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such.

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

All buildings in the property are supplied with heat and cooling via the power grid of the new energy center. For heat supply, hybrid energy sources are used. These consist of the renewable raw material wood, a wood pellet boiler plant, as well as the fossil energy natural gas, gas condensing boilers and an integrated combined heat and power plant. The cold is generated by free-cooling, high-efficiency compression machines and absorption chillers. This can save 30 percent of primary energy compared to today. In addition, CO2 emissions will be reduced by more than 30 percent. The overall concept is modular in design and adaptable for the future.",

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

For example, by replacing old appliances which - now recognizable - consume a lot of energy with new ones or choose a different time of day with more favorable electricity prices for the use of a washing machine or dishwasher.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

Our first priority is to cut in half the total energy demand of the city until 2050 and then cover the rest with renewable energy and/or waste heat. To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally. This is why we want to increase the share of district heating in the city.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such.

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

The need for heating is already low due to the good insulation of the evohaus architecture anyway. Remaining heat demand is covered by solar power. The solar power drives heat pumps that produce about three kilowatt hours of heat energy for heating or hot water with one kilowatt hour of electrical energy. The settlement gets its heat independent of gas, coal or other fossil fuels. The heat pumps are preferably switched on when enough solar power is generated. Water tanks store excess heat and provide the settlement with sunless times. An energy management system monitors and controls storage tanks and heat pumps. The evohaus irq concept is taking the step from a passive house to an active house: it not only saves energy but also generates electricity itself and uses it with intelligence.",

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

In addition, these high-performance tires significantly reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles compared to standard tires. These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time.

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence.

Our first priority is to cut in half the total energy demand of the city until 2050 and then cover the rest with renewable energy and/or waste heat. To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally. This is why we want to increase the share of district heating in the city.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such. B. that the fire department is called. In order to test some scenarios and saving opportunities in everyday life and to make known the possibilities offered by these modern technologies, Smart Home applications were installed on the Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e in nine private apartments of the Nippes Tower and in the bookstore Neusser Stra\u00c3\u0178e. This was financed by the project Klimastra\u00c3\u0178e or the company RocketHome . In addition, it is planned to equip the entire climate road with smart meters from RheinEnergie.",

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

To use large amounts of waste heat (e.g. from a waste incineration plant, industry, datacentres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) you need a distribution system, because it is not useable only locally.

These are the results of a joint tire test carried out by LANXESS, the world's leading manufacturer of synthetic high-performance rubbers for the tire industry, together with energy supplier RheinEnergie. RheinEnergie has therefore decided to gradually convert its vehicle fleet to \"green tires\". Initially, around 130 vehicles will be retrofitted as part of the usual wear change. For half a year, under real conditions, the fuel consumption of six identical RheinEnergie service vehicles in Cologne and the surrounding area was compared with both \"green tires\" and standard tires, thus determining the potential for savings. The vehicles with a weight of around two tons had comparable areas of application in the city of Cologne and the surrounding area during the test period. Driver, load weight and tank operations were identical for the vehicles. Over the entire test period, all six vehicles together covered a distance of around 37,000 kilometers. The result: The maximum fuel saving was 6.96 percent and a lower CO2 emission of up to 155 kilograms per 10,000 kilometers.",

So you can control from your smartphone whether the stove is still on at home, a window has been left open, the heating is running at full speed or the light is on. In addition, before the house is on fire, modern, networked smoke detectors report any alarm directly to the owner's smartphone. It can automatically be initiated various steps, such.

    "PrjName": "The energy transition presents network operators and energy providers with particular challenges. Both have to deal with an increasing share of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity grid. Wind turbines and photovoltaic systems produce electricity, however, depending on the weather and therefore fluctuating. For a secure supply, it is necessary that electricity production and consumption are always balanced as much as possible. In order for this to succeed, utilities and network operators must always know where and in what quantity energy is generated and consumed. Only then can production and consumption be optimally coordinated. However, continuous metering is not possible with today's metering technology.The solution to the problem is smart metering. In the future, so-called \"smart metering systems\" will transfer consumption data to grid operators and energy providers. This ensures that they can optimally control the network at any time. The technology is mainly used in households and businesses with high annual consumption.Consumers can access the data at any time. The additional transparency helps them to further increase their energy efficiency and thereby reduce costs. New services provided by energy suppliers are intended to reinforce the positive effects.",

For this purpose, demonstration plants were built at three different locations in the city. In Cologne-Wahn and Cologne-M\u00c3\u00bclheim, the heat is extracted directly from the sewer using so-called gutter heat exchangers. The heat exchangers with a length of 60 and 120 meters are installed at the bottom of the canal. The heat transfer medium transports the heat from there to the heat pumps with a capacity of 150 or 200 kW in the boiler rooms of the schools supplied. In Cologne-Nippes, a total of three schools and a sports hall are supplied by sewage heat. Here, the wastewater is pumped through a newly laid, 400-meter-long bypass to the boiler room of the Edith Stein-.Realschule. There, in the largest direct evaporator in Germany (400 kW), heat is transferred directly to the heating circuit of the schools. With the three demonstration plants, an environmental relief of a total of 500 t CO2 / year is achieved. The use of wastewater heat is technically mature and well developed. Nevertheless, this form of waste heat utilization has so far been a niche existence. This is partly because it is still little known, often the necessary information is not available locally, their implementation is relatively complex and requires high investment. Further reducing these barriers is the goal of the Cologne CELSIUS project. ",

The measured values \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039can also be accessed via various platforms, eg. Web pages and smart phone apps.
