Each school was provided with a secure wireless network but was free to choose its pedagogical approach to using the technology. Students were asked to bring a laptop, tablet or phone to school (in 90% of cases they chose a smartphone). The schools were supported with training and with advice on legal and data protection issues (all parents were given a document to sign explaining what the devices would be used for). The Hamburg schools authority also provided a learning platform which gives access to digital materials and allows students to communicate, submit homework and complete self-assessments.",

Each school was provided with a secure wireless network but was free to choose its pedagogical approach to using the technology. Students were asked to bring a laptop, tablet or phone to school (in 90% of cases they chose a smartphone). The schools were supported with training and with advice on legal and data protection issues (all parents were given a document to sign explaining what the devices would be used for). The Hamburg schools authority also provided a learning platform which gives access to digital materials and allows students to communicate, submit homework and complete self-assessments.",

These new tools allow the visualization and simulation of complex urban developments and support urban actors in the decision-making process (more under Research and Teaching ).The city of Hamburg is the \"Living Lab\", in which urban change processes are comprehensively researched and developed right down to concrete applications.

It was launched two years ago with the aim of improving learning outcomes by using technology in the classroom. Six pilot schools were selected to take part in the project with over 90 classes and 2,000 students involved. Each school was provided with a secure wireless network but was free to choose its pedagogical approach to using the technology. Students were asked to bring a laptop, tablet or phone to school (in 90% of cases they chose a smartphone). The schools were supported with training and with advice on legal and data protection issues (all parents were given a document to sign explaining what the devices would be used for). The Hamburg schools authority also provided a learning platform which gives access to digital materials and allows students to communicate, submit homework and complete self-assessments.",
