    "PrjName": "The moveBW project offers drivers an attractive option that links motorized personal transport with alternative modes of transportation. An easy-to-use mobility assistant on your smartphone helps you choose a mode of transportation and reliably guides you to your destination. Users of the mobility assistant can book different types of transportation  yet receive just one bill that lists every mode booked during the past month. To plan intermodal routes, the mobility assistant considers services such as public transportation, car sharing, bike sharing, and parking-space management as well as information on traffic jams and construction areas. MoveBW encourages people in the greater Stuttgart area to efficiently utilize all modes of transportation, which eases congestion. This project also aids local authorities in optimizing regional traffic flows.MoveBW is overseen by a consortium of six companies, led by Robert Bosch GmbH: transportation solutions company highQ, parking-space operator Parkraumgesellschaft Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, TraffiCon GmbH, PRISMA Solutions GmbH, and MRK Management Consultants. The moveBW project began in mid-2016 and will end in late 2017.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car.

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

For example, orange marked places do not have a toilet. Locations that are displayed in red can not be entered by wheelchair users.

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Since November 2010, there is also the free iPhone app.A simple traffic light system marks the wheelchair accessibility of the places: Green means unrestricted access. For example, orange marked places do not have a toilet. Locations that are displayed in red can not be entered by wheelchair users. With the help of this traffic light, people with reduced mobility can find suitable places in their environment and even worldwide. Since places are also listed that are not wheelchair accessible, owners of caf\u00c3\u00a9s or other public places are made aware of the problem and encouraged to think about wheelchair accessibility in their rooms.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Since November 2010, there is also the free iPhone app.A simple traffic light system marks the wheelchair accessibility of the places: Green means unrestricted access. For example, orange marked places do not have a toilet. Locations that are displayed in red can not be entered by wheelchair users. With the help of this traffic light, people with reduced mobility can find suitable places in their environment and even worldwide. Since places are also listed that are not wheelchair accessible, owners of caf\u00c3\u00a9s or other public places are made aware of the problem and encouraged to think about wheelchair accessibility in their rooms.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

To plan intermodal routes, the mobility assistant considers services such as public transportation, car sharing, bike sharing, and parking-space management as well as information on traffic jams and construction areas. MoveBW encourages people in the greater Stuttgart area to efficiently utilize all modes of transportation, which eases congestion. This project also aids local authorities in optimizing regional traffic flows.MoveBW is overseen by a consortium of six companies, led by Robert Bosch GmbH: transportation solutions company highQ, parking-space operator Parkraumgesellschaft Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, TraffiCon GmbH, PRISMA Solutions GmbH, and MRK Management Consultants.

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Then you get on the map exactly the destinations shown, which can be reached from your own location in 30 min or 60 min currently by train, bus or bike. ",

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

For example, orange marked places do not have a toilet. Locations that are displayed in red can not be entered by wheelchair users.

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Since November 2010, there is also the free iPhone app.A simple traffic light system marks the wheelchair accessibility of the places: Green means unrestricted access. For example, orange marked places do not have a toilet. Locations that are displayed in red can not be entered by wheelchair users. With the help of this traffic light, people with reduced mobility can find suitable places in their environment and even worldwide.

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Since November 2010, there is also the free iPhone app.A simple traffic light system marks the wheelchair accessibility of the places: Green means unrestricted access. For example, orange marked places do not have a toilet. Locations that are displayed in red can not be entered by wheelchair users. With the help of this traffic light, people with reduced mobility can find suitable places in their environment and even worldwide. Since places are also listed that are not wheelchair accessible, owners of caf\u00c3\u00a9s or other public places are made aware of the problem and encouraged to think about wheelchair accessibility in their rooms.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

An easy-to-use mobility assistant on your smartphone helps you choose a mode of transportation and reliably guides you to your destination. Users of the mobility assistant can book different types of transportation  yet receive just one bill that lists every mode booked during the past month. To plan intermodal routes, the mobility assistant considers services such as public transportation, car sharing, bike sharing, and parking-space management as well as information on traffic jams and construction areas. MoveBW encourages people in the greater Stuttgart area to efficiently utilize all modes of transportation, which eases congestion. This project also aids local authorities in optimizing regional traffic flows.MoveBW is overseen by a consortium of six companies, led by Robert Bosch GmbH: transportation solutions company highQ, parking-space operator Parkraumgesellschaft Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, TraffiCon GmbH, PRISMA Solutions GmbH, and MRK Management Consultants.

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Since November 2010, there is also the free iPhone app.A simple traffic light system marks the wheelchair accessibility of the places: Green means unrestricted access. For example, orange marked places do not have a toilet. Locations that are displayed in red can not be entered by wheelchair users.

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Since November 2010, there is also the free iPhone app.A simple traffic light system marks the wheelchair accessibility of the places: Green means unrestricted access. For example, orange marked places do not have a toilet. Locations that are displayed in red can not be entered by wheelchair users.

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Since November 2010, there is also the free iPhone app.A simple traffic light system marks the wheelchair accessibility of the places: Green means unrestricted access. For example, orange marked places do not have a toilet. Locations that are displayed in red can not be entered by wheelchair users. With the help of this traffic light, people with reduced mobility can find suitable places in their environment and even worldwide. Since places are also listed that are not wheelchair accessible, owners of caf\u00c3\u00a9s or other public places are made aware of the problem and encouraged to think about wheelchair accessibility in their rooms.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

During a four-week trial period, testers were able to try out a wide range of sponsored mobility solutions, all with the goal of making the transition to multimodal mobility easier. Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",

Focus Areas The project builds on the initial results of the New Mobility Berlin project which discovered that car owners will only switch to multimodal transportation and give up their own cars if they can first give it a trial run. In order to facilitate the switch, they need to experience the existing multimodal mobility offerings in Berlin. These offerings also need to be expanded locally as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) adapted to the needs of users. A sponsored mobility package of Berlin public transport and the city's car sharing companies made it possible for car owners to try out living without a private car. The test also provided important information about user requirements for MaaS.",
