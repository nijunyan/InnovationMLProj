The result is a mobility patchwork that is tailored to the individual circumstances and that can be configured quickly and easily at any time. Energy-efficient and space-saving mobility has priority here. \"Sharing\" is smart!

This is where the bicycle rental system of the Cologne Transport Company (KVB) comes in by closing a gap in the combination of environmentally conscious and mobility-active mobility. The bicycle rental system of KVB stands for an open architecture.

The resident of a smart city does not remain loyal to one mode of transport. The result is a mobility patchwork that is tailored to the individual circumstances and that can be configured quickly and easily at any time. Energy-efficient and space-saving mobility has priority here. \"Sharing\" is smart! The sharing of things and information already establishes itself under the term \"sharing economy\" and places the function before the property, in order to use existing resources more efficiently. Smart mobility in urban areas is therefore primarily a matter of sharing a networked mobility offer from buses, trains, bicycles and cars. Smart mobility is not just a technological task. Especially in the inner cities, walking and cycling will provide space for quality of life and urban development through active mobility. This is where the bicycle rental system of the Cologne Transport Company (KVB) comes in by closing a gap in the combination of environmentally conscious and mobility-active mobility. The bicycle rental system of KVB stands for an open architecture. It is therefore not a system with only fixed station terminals after the well-known role models from other major cities, because a template for all cases, the complex events of a city can consider insufficient. The system offers users fully flexible rental and return in the street, but also stationary station terminals depending on the available options and needs.

The result is a mobility patchwork that is tailored to the individual circumstances and that can be configured quickly and easily at any time. Energy-efficient and space-saving mobility has priority here. \"Sharing\" is smart! The sharing of things and information already establishes itself under the term \"sharing economy\" and places the function before the property, in order to use existing resources more efficiently.

The resident of a smart city does not remain loyal to one mode of transport. The result is a mobility patchwork that is tailored to the individual circumstances and that can be configured quickly and easily at any time. Energy-efficient and space-saving mobility has priority here. \"Sharing\" is smart! The sharing of things and information already establishes itself under the term \"sharing economy\" and places the function before the property, in order to use existing resources more efficiently.

    "PrjName": "KVB cycle hire Smart mobility Smart mobility is climate-friendly, sustainable, space-saving and networked. It relies on diversity and multimodality. The resident of a smart city does not remain loyal to one mode of transport. The result is a mobility patchwork that is tailored to the individual circumstances and that can be configured quickly and easily at any time. Energy-efficient and space-saving mobility has priority here. \"Sharing\" is smart! The sharing of things and information already establishes itself under the term \"sharing economy\" and places the function before the property, in order to use existing resources more efficiently. Smart mobility in urban areas is therefore primarily a matter of sharing a networked mobility offer from buses, trains, bicycles and cars. Smart mobility is not just a technological task. Especially in the inner cities, walking and cycling will provide space for quality of life and urban development through active mobility. This is where the bicycle rental system of the Cologne Transport Company (KVB) comes in by closing a gap in the combination of environmentally conscious and mobility-active mobility. The bicycle rental system of KVB stands for an open architecture. It is therefore not a system with only fixed station terminals after the well-known role models from other major cities, because a template for all cases, the complex events of a city can consider insufficient. The system offers users fully flexible rental and return in the street, but also stationary station terminals depending on the available options and needs. The rental terminals cover the entire span between conventional stations and purely virtual stations. ",
